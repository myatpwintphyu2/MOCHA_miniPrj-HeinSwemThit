<p>The Grand Place is the main square of Brussels, and it is easily one of the city's best attractions. 
<br>
<br>
Quaint cobblestones fill the ground and incredible gold-trimmed buildings surround the square. The most famous building in the Grand Place is the magnificent Town Hall that was built in the early 15th Century.
<br>
<br>
The architecture and historical significance of the Grand Place is very impressive, and the spot has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
<br>
<br>
This is one of the best places to visit in Brussels for free, and also one of the best places to visit in Brussels during Christmas because the square fills up with charming markets. Even outside the Christmas Season, sometimes you can find a little flower market in the Grand Place on weekends.</p>
<h2 class="pdj">Place du Jeu de Balle Market</h2>

<p>This outdoor flea market is also known as the "Old Market" to locals, maybe because the market has been running since 1873. This is one of the most-visited markets in Brussels, and it is open every single day.
<br>
<br>
The flea market is massive, and you can find everything here from vintage clothes, shoes and accessories, to books, CDs and records, to sculptures and artwork. The theme of the market leans towards the vintage side, so you'll find lots of antiques and unique items.
<br>
<br>
Even if you don't plan on buying anything, walking through the market is a fun and interesting experience. You'll see lots of cool stuff, including artifacts and antiques from hundreds of years ago.
<br>
<br>
The market takes place in the Marolles District, where markets and merchants have been thriving since the 17th Century. At 7 am the market opens, and it closes at 2 pm on weekdays and 3 pm on weekends.</p>
