<h1>Japan</h1>
<img src="Image2/japan 2.jpg" width="380px" height="170px">
<p>Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south.</p>

<h2>Tokyo</h2>

<img src="Image/tokyo 2.jpg" width="380px" height="200px">
<p>Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum). </p>

<p class="bioptg">Here we recommend you some famous places to visit when you are on a trip to Tokyo, Japan. </p>
<h2 class="tst"> Tokyo Skytree</h2>

<p>It's hard to miss the Tokyo Skytree (Tōkyō Sukaitsurī). This 634-meter-tall communications and observation tower rises out of the city's Sumida district of Minato like a huge rocket ship.
<br>
The country's tallest structure (and the world's tallest freestanding tower), the Tokyo Skytree opened in 2012 and has quickly become one of the city's most visited tourist attractions thanks to the incredible panoramic views from its restaurant and observation decks.
<br>
With a base designed in the form of a massive tripod, the tower includes a number of cylindrical observation levels, including one at the 350-meter mark, and another at the 450-meter point - the latter includes a unique glass spiral walkway to an even higher viewpoint with glass floors for those with strong stomachs.
<br>
Be sure to also check out the smaller and much older Tokyo Tower, built in 1958 and once the city's tallest structure.
<br>
Address: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo</p>
<h2 class="ms">Meiji Shrine</h2>

<p>Dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken, construction of the splendid Meiji Shrine (Meiji Jingū) began in 1915 and was completed in 1926. Although the original structure was destroyed during WWII, it was rebuilt in 1958 and remains one of Tokyo's most important religious sites.
<br>
Surrounded by a 175-acre evergreen forest that is home to some 120,000 trees representing species found across Japan – as well as the interesting "wishing tree," on which visitors can write and hang their deepest wishes – the shrine's highlights include its Inner Precinct (Naien) with its museum containing royal treasures, and the Outer Precinct (Gaien).
<br>
It's in the Outer Precinct that you'll find the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery with its superb collection of murals relating to the lives of the emperor and empress. Be sure to also visit the adjacent Meiji Shrine Inner Garden (Yoyogi Gyoen), an attractive public garden complete with a teahouse, iris garden, and a pleasant arbor.

Address: 1-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, Tokyo</p>

	<h1 style="text-align:center;">EVENTS</h1>
	<p class="bioevents"> Here is a famous festival or event that is celebrated in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
	<h2 class="gm">Gion Matsuri</h2>
	<img src="Image2/gm japan 1.jpg" width="300px" height="190px">
	<img src="Image2/gm japan 2.jpg" width="300px" height="190px">
	<img src="Image2/gm japan 3.jpg" width="300px" height="190px">
	<p>Gion Matsuri (祇園祭), the festival of Yasaka Shrine, is the most famous festival in Japan. It takes place over the entire month of July. There are many different events, but the grand procession of floats (Yamaboko Junko) on July 17 is particularly spectacular. Very enjoyable are also the festive evenings preceding the procession (Yoiyama).
<br>
From the year 2014, a second procession of floats was reintroduced on July 24 after a hiatus of 48 years. The second procession features fewer and smaller floats than the one on July 17.</p>
<h3 class="gm">Floats and history</h3>
<p>The word Yamaboko refers to the two types of floats used in the procession: the 23 yama and 10 hoko. One of the main reasons the Gion Matsuri is so impressive is the enormity of the hoko, which are up to 25 meters tall, weigh up to 12 tons, and are pulled on wheels as big as people. Both yama and hoko are elaborately decorated and represent unique themes. The procession on July 17 features 23 yama and hoko, including most of the particularly impressive hoko, while the procession on July 24 features the remaining ten yama and hoko.
<br>
Another reason for the festival's impressiveness is its long and almost uninterrupted history. It dates back to 869 as a religious ceremony to appease the gods during the outbreak of an epidemic. Even today, the festival continues the practice of selecting a local boy to be a divine messenger. The child cannot set foot on the ground from the 13th until after he has been paraded through town on the 17th.</p>
<h3 class="gm">Main events</h3>
<p>Ironically, the highlight events of Gion Matsuri do not actually take place in the Gion district but rather on the opposite side of Kamo River. During the three days preceding the procession, the respective yama and hoko are displayed within about a half kilometer of the intersection of Karasuma and Shijo streets (see map below). While they are on display, some of the floats can be entered by tourists.
<br>
The area becomes most exciting in the evenings, when from 18:00 until 23:00 the streets are closed to traffic and the area swells with food stands, drink vendors and other festival hallmarks. These festive evenings leading up to the procession are known as Yoiyama (July 16), Yoiyoiyama (July 15) and Yoiyoiyoiyama (July 14). Similar festivities also take place on the three evenings leading up to the procession on July 24, albeit on a smaller scale and with fewer road closures and stands. In 2022, road closures will happen only on July 15 and 16.
<br>
The processions of floats (Yamaboko Junko) take place between 9:00 and 13:00 on the 17th and from 9:30 to 11:50 on the 24th and follow a three kilometer long route along Shijo, Kawaramachi and Oike streets (starting from Shijo-Karasuma on the 17th and from Karasuma-Oike on the 24th). Some paid seating is provided in front of the city hall (4100 yen; advance booking required), but because the procession takes place over quite a long route and duration, good viewpoints can also be found elsewhere without too much trouble.</p>
<h3 class="gm">Other events</h3>
<p>Gion Matsuri's other events are not quite as impressive but also enjoyable. From July 10 to 14 (and from July 18 to 21 for the second procession), visitors can watch the assembling of the floats, which is done from scratch and without the use of nails each year. The Byobu Matsuri, which coincides with the days of Yoiyama, involves local residents opening their front doors and exhibiting family heirlooms to passersby.
<br>
The procession of mikoshi takes place from 18:00 on the 17th, starting at Yasaka Shrine and ending at the Otabisho. The event involves carrying the shrine's deity out of the shrine grounds and through the town in a mikoshi, a portable shrine, which is set on wooden beams and carried on the shoulders of local men. On the 24th, the mikoshi is returned to the shrine. In 2022, the route will be shortened.
